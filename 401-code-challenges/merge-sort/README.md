## MERGE SORT

 - MERGE SORTS:
 - Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Conceptually, a Merge sort works as follows: 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted), 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. From Wikipedia
